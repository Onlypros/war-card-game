# Project 1 War

## How to play
1. Take a deck of cards, shuffle and then split in half 
    - Half for the player and half for the computer
2. Players then flip over the top card of their decks and place them in the middle
    - Whoever has the highest card wins that round
        - increase winners score by 1 point
    - If there is a tie move onto the next round
3. Repeat until all cards have been dealt
4. Whoever has the highest score after 26 rounds wins
5. Add a reset button so they can play again
