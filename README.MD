# Welcome to War!

## Description

This is a simple version of the Ward card game. I initially wanted to try and make Blackjack but I switched to War after not making much progress.

## How to play
1. Simply click on the "Draw a card" button to play each hand. After the timer expires a winner will be determined by whoever won the most hands throughout the match. In the off chance that a player takes all of the opponent's cards the game will also end and declare them the winner.
